# Linked list
Visualize：https://visualgo.net/en/list

###Circular linked list
	- The last node points to the head
###DLL：double linked list
	- Each node points to previous node and next node

####Compare the use of static and dynamic data structures
	- Static data structure has a predetermined number of elements but number of elements in dynamic data structure does not have to be defined in advance;	
	- Static data structure has limitied size, the amount of memory available is the only limit in size of dynamic data structure, size varies;
	- In static data structure elements can be directly accessed, in a dynamic data structure access is sequential, which is slower 
 
####Describe, with the aid of a suitable diagram, a dynamic singly linked list

	- Internal pointers
	- External pointer to the list and no further nodes at the end
	- Each node contains data and pointer fields

####How an item could be found in this list
	- Temporary pointer should be set to point to the beginning of the list;
	- Follow the internal pointers
	- Compare the data in the node pointed to by the temporary pointer with the searched data
	- If found stop searching
	- If the end of the list is reached then the searched data is not on the list

####Identify the components of a node in a doubly linked list
	- Data
	- A pointer to the previous node
	- A pointer to the next node

####How to insert
	- Initially compare with node pointed to by the head
	- (If not correctly place) move through list using pointers until correct alphabetical position is found
	- Adjust pointers accordingly

#### Descirbe how the number of names held in this list could be determined
	- Use a variable(counter) to keep track of/ increment the number of nodes
	- Use a temporary pointer
	- Follow the pointers from the beginning of the list/ from the node pointed to by pointer X.next
	- Until the pointer to the end of the list(pointer X) is encountered

#### Explain how a stack could be used to output, in reverse order, all names held in the linked list
	- Initialize an empty stack
	- traverse the list from beginning to end
	- pushing each data value from the list onto the stack
	- while the stack is not empty
	- popping an element from the stack and output the stack element
