## Abstract data structures

  ### Array: two iterations
  
  - Index: array[m][n]
    
  ### Stack: FILO -> recursion
  
  - Function stored as stack in memory -> recursion
    
  - Pointer: return memory addresses
    
  - Methods: push, pop, isEmpty
    
  ### Queue: FIFO
  
  - Both linear and circular queue
    
  - Methods: enqueue, dequeue, inEmpty
    
  ### Static queue
  
## Liked lists
- Dynamic data structure
- Easy to append and pop, difficult to iterate and search
  - Array: continuous memory address; linked list: discrete memory address
- Sketch

## Trees
- Root not -> intermidient not -> leaf not
- Each not can only have zero, one, or two leaf-child not
- Parent, left-child, right-child, subtree, root, leaf
- Inorder( -> root - left - right), postorder( -> left - right - root), preorder( -> left - root - right), tree traversal
  
## Prefix, postfix
- 3*(2+2)
- +*322
- 322+*: 22+:=4*3:=12 -> get rid of kuohao
