## Parallel Processing System 🐶

### Floating-point unit 🛥
- 浮点数：小数点可以浮动的数 
- 提高精度：Exponent少点，Mantissa多点 -> tradeoff
- Difficult to calculate -> Co-processor 协处理器, designed for 算浮点运算
  - GPU -> 浮点计算单元
  
### Pipelining 🔧

- Fetch, decode, execute <- 3 parts
- "Split the processor up into 3 parts, each of which handles one of the 3 stages"
- Jump instruction

### Array processor 🚀

- Multiple ALU, CPU
- Simple instruction, but the instruction is applied to lots of data sets

## OS & AS

### OS 💻

#### Polling & Interrupt

- Interrupt: handling interrupt, wait for the next instruction
- Polling: asking for instructions all the time

### AS (application system)

- Example: word, safari...
- Application 建立在 OS 上，硬件和电脑的操作都要靠OS搞定
- Word processing, gaming, videos...
- Common features of application
  - Toolbars, menus, dialogue boxes, GUI components
  
### OS vd Application Features

- Some parts are provided by OS, others are specific to each application
- Different OS may give different OS generic (样子)
