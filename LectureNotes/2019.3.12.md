## Parallel Processing System

### Floating-point unit
- 浮点数：小数点可以浮动的数
- 提高精度：Exponent少点，Mantissa多点 -> tradeoff
- Difficult to calculate -> Co-processor 协处理器, designed for 算浮点运算
  - GPU -> 浮点计算单元
  
### Pipelining

- Fetch, decode, execute <- 3 parts
- "Split the processor up into 3 parts, each of which handles one of the 3 stages"
- Jump instruction

### Array processor

- Multiple ALU, CPU
- Simple instruction, but the instruction is applied to lots of data sets
